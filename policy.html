        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>We take the protection of our Users’ personal data seriously. The following Privacy Policy is therefore 
          intended to inform you about the processing of your personal data in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 
          ("GDPR"). In particular, we explain which personal data we collect, for what purposes we process these personal 
          data, which technologies we use, to whom we transfer personal data and what rights you are entitled to under the GDPR.</p>
        <h3>1.  General Information</h3>
        <p>1.1  Controller within the meaning of the GDPR is METRO-nom GmbH, Metro-Straße 12, 40235 Düsseldorf (“Metronom“, “we“ or “us“).</p>
        <p>1.2  If you have any questions regarding the protection of personal data, you may contact our Data Protection Officer using 
          the following contact details: METRO-nom GmbH, Data Protection Officer, Metro-Straße 12, 40235 Düsseldorf, 
          email: datenschutz@metronom.com. </p>
        </p>
        <h4>A. 	Processing of Personal Data on our Website</h4>
        <h3>2.  Automated Processing of Personal Data when Accessing our Website</h3>
        <p>2.1  When you access and use our website via your terminal device (this may be your computer, your mobile phone or a 
          comparable internet-enabled terminal device), we process personal data automatically. This includes </p>
            <span>- the IP address currently used by your terminal device,</span>
            <span>- date and time when the website was accessed,</span> 
            <span>- the browser type and the operating system of your terminal device;</span>
            <span>- the initial website from which you accessed our website and</span> 
            <span>- the sub-pages visited on our website.</span>
          <p>2.2  Processing the IP address of your terminal device is necessary for us to make the website available 
            to you and thus serves the functionality of the website. The processing of the other data mentioned in 
            section 2.1 of this Privacy Policy takes place for the purposes of data security and the security of our IT systems 
            as well as for the optimization of our services and for the improvement of our website. The data mentioned in section 
            2.1 of this Privacy Policy are stored in a separate log file and are not linked to any other stored personal data. 
            An evaluation of these data, with the exception of statistical purposes and then generally in anonymous form, is only 
            carried out within the scope of this Privacy Policy. The data mentioned in section 2.1 of this Privacy Policy will not be 
            used for marketing or advertising purposes. The processing is carried out on the basis of Article 6 para. 1 sentence 1 letter f) GDPR. 
            Protecting our website and optimizing our services is a legitimate interest on our part.
            </p>
          <p>2.3  The data mentioned under 2.1 of this Privacy Policy will be stored until the purpose of the processing has 
            ceased to apply. The data required for the provision of the website (your IP address) will be deleted after the end of the 
            respective browser session, i.e. when you leave the website or close your browser. The deletion of the log files in which this data is 
            stored is done automatically and usually within fourteen (14) days after creation of the log file. If the other data mentioned 
            in section 2.1 of this Privacy Policy are also processed by us for evaluation purposes, this is done without reference to the 
            IP address, so that we can no longer establish a personal reference.
            </p>
        <h3>3.  Cookies</h3>
        <p>In order to make our services and our website as User-friendly as possible and to enable the use of 
          certain functions of the website, we use so-called Cookies. These are small text files that are stored on your terminal 
          device by your browser. A text file of this type contains a characteristic character string that allows the browser to be uniquely 
          identified when the website is accessed again. For example, Cookies can be used to automatically recognize certain website settings 
          you have selected for your next visit. Some of the Cookies we use are required in order to provide you with the website (technically necessary Cookies). 
          Other Cookies are used to analyze your usage behavior (analysis Cookies) or for advertising purposes (advertising Cookies). 
          Some of the Cookies we use are deleted after the end of a session, i.e. after closing your browser (session Cookies). 
          Other Cookies remain on your terminal device and enable us to recognize your browser the next time you visit our website (persistent Cookies). 
          You can set your browser in such a way that you are informed about the placing of Cookies and can decide individually about their acceptance 
          or exclude the acceptance of Cookies for certain cases or generally. Please refer to your browser's help function for more information. 
          Your browser also contains settings that prevent Cookies from being placed. As a user, you therefore have full control over the use of Cookies. 
          By changing the settings in your browser, you can deactivate or restrict the transmission of cookies (and thus object to the creation 
          of pseudonyms in accordance with § 15 Para. 3 TMG). Cookies that have already been saved can be deleted at any time. This can also be done 
          automatically by setting your browser accordingly. Certain Cookies also offer further technical options (such as setting an "opt-out Cookie") 
          in order to object to the use of the Cookie. Information on this can be found in the respective detailed description of the Cookie further down below. 
          However, the functionality of our website may be limited if Cookies are prevented from being placed. In detail:</p>
        <p>3.1  To enable the website to function properly, we use technically necessary Cookies, for example to store language settings 
          and log-in information. The legal basis for the processing of technically necessary Cookies is Article 6 para. 1 sentence 1 letter f) GDPR. 
          The functionality of our website is a legitimate interest.
          </p>
        <p>3.2  We use analysis Cookies that allow us to track your use of our website, e.g. which third-party website you came from, which sub-pages of our 
          website you visit and which links you clicked on and how often. The data collected about you in this way is pseudonymised by us through technical precautions. 
          After pseudonymization, direct assignment of the data to the User is no longer possible. The data will not be stored together with other personal data. 
          The use of analysis Cookies serves to improve our website and the content offered there. By accepting our "Cookie banner", you consent to the 
          processing of your personal data through analysis Cookies. These personal data are processed on the basis of Article 6 para.
           1 sentence 1 letter a) GDPR. We use the following analysis Cookies:</p>
        <p>We also use Google Analytics, a web analysis service provided by Google Inc. (1600 Amphitheatre Parkway,
           Mountain View, CA 94043, USA; "Google"). Google Analytics also uses Cookies. The information generated by the Cookies about 
           your use of this website is usually transferred to a Google server in the USA and stored there. However, prior to 
           that Google will shorten your IP address within member states of the European Union or in other states party to the Agreement 
           on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transmitted to a Google server in the USA and shortened there. 
           On our behalf, Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports on website activity and to provide 
           us with other services relating to website and Internet use. The IP address transmitted by your browser in the context of Google Analytics is not 
           merged with other Google data. You may refuse the use of Cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser. You can also prevent Google from 
           collecting the data generated by the Cookies and relating to your use of the website (including your IP address) and from processing this data by 
           Google by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available under the following link: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en.
          </p>
        <h4>B.  Further Information Regarding the Processing</h4>
        <h3>4.  Contact</h3>
        <p>You can contact us through various channels:
          </p>
        <p>4.1   You can use the contact form on our website to contact us for a request. The personal data you enter in the contact form 
          (your first and last name, your e-mail address and details of the nature of your request are required) will only be processed 
          for the purpose of responding to your enquiry and only if you have clicked on the "Send" button. Your IP address and the time of 
          sending your request will also be stored. Processing is carried out on the basis of Article 6 para. 1 sentence 1 letter a) GDPR. 
          </p>
        <p>4.2  You can also contact us by telephone or e-mail. In this respect, too, only the personal data required to respond to your enquiry will be processed. 
          Processing is carried out on the basis of Article 6 para. 1 sentence 1 letter a) GDPR. </p>
        <p>4.3  You can object to the storage of your data at any time, for example by e-mail to datenschutz@metronom.com. 
          In this case, however, further processing of your request is not possible. Furthermore, the revocation has no effect on the 
          legality of the processing of your data until then.
          </p>
        <h3>5.  Transfer of Personal Data to Third Parties</h3>
          <p>5.1  To process personal data, we use service Providers with whom we have concluded an agreement
            for order processing in accordance with the legal requirements of Article 28 GDPR, provided that they 
            act as processors. Such service Providers support us, for example, in sending e-mails or in the technical 
            operation and hosting of the website. These service Providers can be based both inside and outside the 
            European Union or the European Economic Area. Through contractual agreements with the service Providers, 
            we ensure that these personal data are processed in accordance with the requirements of the GDPR, even if 
            the data processing takes place outside the European Union or the European Economic Area in countries 
            where an appropriate level of data protection is otherwise not guaranteed and for which no adequacy 
            decision of the European Commission exists. For further information on the existence of a European 
            Commission adequacy decision and appropriate guarantees and to obtain a copy of these guarantees, 
            please contact our Data Protection Officer at datenschutz@metronom.com. 
            </p>
          <p>5.2  If necessary to find out if the Software has been abused and a legal prosecution might be necessary 
            or a legal obligation for disclosure exists, personal data are passed on to authorities (in particular 
            prosecution authorities and tax authorities), our legal defense as well as, if necessary, to damaged third 
            parties. A disclosure may also take place if this serves to enforce our General Terms and Conditions or other 
            agreements or is required by a legal or official order or a court order. The legal basis for processing is 
            Article. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 letter f) GDPR, for example if the disclosure is necessary for a legal dispute, 
            or Article 6 para. 1 sentence 1 letter c) GDPR, insofar as a statutory obligation exists. The data will be 
            deleted as soon as they are no longer necessary to achieve the purpose for which they were collected.
            </p>
          <h3>6.  Deletion of Personal Data</h3>
          <p>The personal data collected in connection with the Services will be stored by us until the contract between 
            you and us is terminated (see our General Terms and Conditions in detail). After termination of the contract 
            your customer account and all relating personal data will be deleted. If we are legally obliged to keep certain 
            personal data collected in connection with the Services even after termination of the contract, we will delete 
            this data as soon as the retention periods have expired.</p>
          <h3>7.  Data Security</h3>
          <p>We use technical and organizational measures to ensure that User‘s personal data are protected against 
            loss, incorrect changes or unauthorized access by third parties. To ensure secure data transmission, 
            the transmission of data is done exclusively via “Secure Socket Layer (SSL)”.</p>
          <h3>8.  Your Rights</h3>
          <p>As a data subject within the meaning of the GDPR, you are entitled to the following rights:</p>
          <span>- The right to obtain information on data processing and a copy of the data processed (right of access, Article 15 GDPR),</span>
          <span>- the right to request the rectification of inaccurate data or the completion of incomplete data (right of rectification, Article 16 GDPR),</span>
          <span>- the right to request the deletion of personal data and, if the personal data have been published, the information to other data controllers on the request for deletion (right of erasure, Article 17 GDPR),</span>
          <span>- the right to request the restriction of data processing (right to restriction of processing, Art. 18 GDPR),</span>
          <span>- the right to receive personal data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and to request the transfer of such data to another controller (right to data portability, Article 20 GDPR),</span>
          <span>- the right to object to data processing in order to prevent it (right of objection, Article 21 GDPR),</span>
          <span>- the right to obtain information about the essential aspects of the joint data controllership agreement where roles and responsibilities of each joint Data Controller regarding the processing of personal data and the mechanisms 
            and procedures for the exercise of the data subjects rights in terms of data protection are regulated,</span>
          <span>- the right to withdraw your consent at any time in order to prevent the processing of data based on your consent. The withdrawal has no influence on the legality of the processing on the basis of 
            the consent before the withdrawal (right of revocation, Article 7 GDPR) as well as</span>
          <span>- the right to object to certain data processing measures (Article 21 GDPR).</span>
          <p>You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority if you believe that data processing infringes the GDPR (right of appeal to a supervisory authority, Article 77 GDPR).</p>
